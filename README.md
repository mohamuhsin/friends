# Tasks

**1.** Create a table named friends with three columns:

> id that stores INTEGER
> name that stores TEXT
> birthday that stores DATE


**2.** Beneath your current code, add Ororo Munroe to friends.

Her birthday is May 30th, 1940.

**3.** Let’s make sure that Ororo has been added to the database:

SELECT * 
FROM friends;

Check for two things:

Is friends table created?
Is Ororo Munroe added to it?

4.
